🧩 Project Idea: “Smart Community Marketplace”

Concept:
A platform for people within the same neighborhood or apartment complex to exchange or rent items (like furniture, tools, bikes, electronics) and share local services (like cleaning, tutoring, etc.).

It’s not a public classified site like Kalabale.lk — it’s a micro-community marketplace restricted to a particular neighborhood.
